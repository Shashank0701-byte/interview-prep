> **Note from the Developer:** This project was more than a technical exercise; it was a journey. It started with a simple idea—to build a better way to prepare for tech interviews—and evolved into a comprehensive platform. Every feature, every challenge, and every line of code represents a real story of problem-solving and growth.

## What It Does: A Smarter Way to Prepare

Interview Prep AI is an intelligent learning platform that transforms how tech professionals prepare for interviews. It moves beyond static flashcards to create a dynamic, feedback-driven ecosystem that helps you not only **know** the material but also **master** communicating it.

* **Build Custom Decks in Seconds:** Create hyper-relevant interview decks for any role, or let the AI build one for you by simply pasting a link to a real job description.
* **Learn with Spaced Repetition:** A smart SRS algorithm schedules your reviews at the optimal time to ensure knowledge moves into your long-term memory.
* **Practice Aloud, Get Real Feedback:** Use your voice to practice your answers and receive instant, AI-powered critiques on your content, clarity, and delivery.
* **Track Your Growth:** A personalized dashboard visualizes your progress, showing you exactly where you're strong and where you need to focus.

## The Story Behind the Build: Challenges & Learnings

A project's true value is in the problems solved along the way. This application's most advanced features are the direct result of tackling and overcoming significant engineering hurdles.

### 1. The AI Reliability Challenge
* **The Ambition:** To provide consistently accurate, structured feedback from the AI.
* **The Roadblock:** The LLM would occasionally "bleed" conversational text around its JSON output, breaking the frontend. After multiple failed attempts to perfect the prompt, the application's core feature was at risk.
* **The Breakthrough:** Instead of trying to force the AI to be perfect, I built a resilient system around its imperfections. I engineered a robust parsing layer on the backend that intelligently finds and extracts the valid JSON from the raw text.
* **The Takeaway:** This was a profound lesson in defensive programming. **A senior engineer's job isn't just to make things work; it's to build systems that don't break when faced with the unexpected.**

### 2. The SRS Algorithm Challenge
* **The Ambition:** To move beyond a simple flashcard app and implement a true Spaced Repetition System.
* **The Roadblock:** Translating the theoretical SM-2 algorithm into performant, stateful backend logic was far more complex than anticipated. My initial attempts were buggy and didn't correctly schedule the review intervals.
* **The Breakthrough:** I took a step back and dedicated time to studying open-source SRS implementations. This research allowed me to refactor my logic, resulting in a stable and effective scheduling engine.
* **The Takeaway:** This taught me the value of deep research before implementation. **Sometimes, the fastest way to solve a problem is to slow down and learn from the work of others.**

This project is a testament to the engineering process: ambition, struggle, learning, and ultimately, resilience.
